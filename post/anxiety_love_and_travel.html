                      <p>The title sums up my college life in three words. I finish my degree next week. This marks a milestone in my life and I thought
        							I might as well write about it.</p>

        							<p>It sure has been hard on me, these past 4 years as an engineering student in India.
        							Unfortunately for me, college has left me nothing to look back to. I remember my dad booking an
        							NRI (Non Resident Indian) seat for me in my university even before I got my entrance exam results.
        							I had a tough time at school too, but that's another story. I was glad I got admitted into
        							Computer Science, and it's all I'd always wanted to do since middle school. Code. I'm fairly good at it.
        							I find happiness puzzling over programs and making them functional. But only later did I realise that I was blissfully
        							unaware of all the puddles of life and catches in the Indian education system.</p>

        							<p><b>In my first year,</b> I met the girl I thought I'd spend the rest of my life with. She was perfect
        							and kind, and vulnerable. She grew into me and my family over the years, and it felt nice. And to complement that part of my life, I had teachers who didn't give two fucks about what
        							students' lives meant - they awarded marks based on our attendance, our obedience in class (you aren't obedient if you have a girlfriend in India),
        							and how well we could rewrite words in our books onto our examination papers. I saw some students leave college,
        							and some students attempt suicide. I was scared.</p>

        							<p><b>My second year</b> didn't get better. I realised that most of my teachers were no different from my first year.
        							In my fourth semester, one of my best buddies died. He was a bright kid. The last conversation I had with him
        							was after class, on a stone bench near the hostels. He was talking about a research paper he was working on.
        							He'd shown me a simulation of an interesting concept for enabling bridges support more weight. A few days later, he and a bunch of people
        							managed to somehow get themselves to a lake near university which we never knew existed, decided to go for a swim,
        							and my friend managed to drown himself. All I could ask myself was 'WHY HIM'? At his funeral, his mum had recognised me from his WhatsApp profile pictures
        							and came up to me, held my hands, and cried - "why'd you let him go?". Enough said.</p>

        							<p><b>In my third year,</b> I was convinced this wasn't working out and I didn't want to waste my parents' money on a piece of paper that <i>proved</i> that I was a <i>qualified</i>
        							Computer Science Engineer. My girlfriend and my brother managed to convince me not to drop out because I couldn't do anything without a degree in India. They were right, because India mints
        							engineers and doctors in the <i>millions</i>. I wouldn't even be one of them if I didn't have that piece of paper. And so I stayed for them. I stayed to satisfy my parents and family.
        							I was thrown out of class several times for dozing off after sleepless nights of online Android development courses (which actually got me somewhere),
        							shouted at several times and had the classroom doors banged on my face for coming a minute late to class, and once for not having combed my hair properly.
        							This was also the year when I'd spent the nights working on an app and a website for a new company I'd registered with a senior friend
        							that my girlfriend was very proud of.</p>

        							<p><b>In my fourth year,</b> I lost my girlfriend because of a drug addict who managed to work his devil's mind into manipulating her into doing
        							something that ruined my relationship, which in turn led me to lose my company and a lot of money - everything I had.
        							What's worse? A professor of mine managed to flunk me after having mistaken me for another boy. And just when I thought things couldn't possibly get any worse,
        							I discovered that I had Keratoconus. My cornea are too thin, my vision is poor, and I need to get my eyes operated.
        							By the time all this happened, I was at the end of my 7th semester. I cried, I tried to fix things, I tried to get my girlfriend back. Nothing worked.
        							I had a semester left. 6 whole months. There was nothing left to do. I saw myself in the
        							middle of a shitstorm I didn't want to be in and couldn't control. So what does one do? Flee. And so I did.</p>

        							<p>I found an opportunity for an internship in Italy. It turned out to be the perfect place for me. I worked on interesting projects, while also
        							getting to visit several European countries during the weekends and long breaks. I got to walk along different countrysides and drool at
        							the kind of landscapes that make you feel so hopelessly insignificant, and I made amazing new friends - English cooks and fishermen, Romanian
        							bartenders, Swedish artists, Danish vegan mathematicians, American Air Force men, Italian window cleaners, Norwegian snowboarders, French researchers,
        							and a Polish guy who fixes tiles in peoples' balconies and had made enough money to travel the world (yes.) - sharing crazy experiences, getting tattoos,
        							laughing our arses off, and sharing memories that can never be forgotten. And to add a cherry on top of it, I got a job in hand. I consider myself a lucky ass, and
        							my hard-work from the nights I spent in my university dorm working and learning had finally paid off.</p>

        							<p>I think I'd seen it all. Good teachers and teachers we loathed. The company of an amazing friend and his unexpected death.
        							The best girlfriend I could ask for, only to lose her because of someone else's greed. But what I'd missed out on is unacceptable.
        							I assumed my relationship was sealed and I'd spent too much time working on things that I thought would make my future better while
        							missing out on late night texts and calls from my girlfriend, the company of my friends, and those tiny moments of happiness having lunch
        							with classmates, or playing cards through the nights. I didn't cherish them all as they happened. I had my mind on other things - work and my future.
        							I always counted on 'later'. 'Later' was my excuse to not spending time with friends, and family. I will NEVER make that mistake again because there
        							is no moment that's more important than <b>now</b>.
        							</p>

        							<p>There seems to be a lot of negativity in this post, and there's probably more to come. But hey, I'm 21. A man's only as good as the amount of shit he's been through.</p>
